Sublime Snake
=============

Snake for Sublime Text 2 & 3

## What?

Ever been frustated with your code? Broken the build? It just won't compile?

Make that source code pay - by eating it with a snake. Obviously.

## Installing

You can now install this plugin using [Sublime Package Manager!](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control), search for 'snake' under packages.

You can install it manually if you wish, you will need to download the source files into a folder within your sublime text packages directory (Preferences -> Browse Packages...)

## Using

To play a game of snake on Windows/Linux press: <pre>ctrl + shift + alt + s</pre> Or on OSX: <pre>command + shift + alt + s</pre>

To stop either lose, or hit that key combination again.

Use the arrow keys to navigate.

## Disclaimer?!

Don't worry this package will unleash a hungry serpent on a copy of your code and leave the original alone.

If you find your arrow keys not working, try restarting sublime. If all else fails log an issue and/or disable the package.

That being said don't blame me if anything goes too wrong.

P.S. I'm tired of these motherfucking snakes in my motherfucking code.
